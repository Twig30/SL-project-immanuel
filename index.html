        <h2>Environmental issues</h2>
        <p>One main Environmental issue that the amazon rainforest today is Deforestation, which is fueled by logging, infrastructural development, and agriculture, is the main cause of the serious environmental problems the Amazon rainforest faces. In addition to endangering biodiversity, this damage releases enormous amounts of carbon dioxide that are stored in trees, which in turn alters the global climate. In addition, pollution and illicit mining worsen ecosystems, endangering not only the complex web of life that depends on this essential habitat but also the livelihoods of Indigenous groups.</p>
