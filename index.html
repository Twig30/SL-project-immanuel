        <h2>Environmental issues</h2>
        <p>One main Environmental issue is deforestation. Deforestation is When a lot of trees and other vegetation are cut down, the Amazon rainforest experiences deforestation, which leads to a permanent loss of forest cover. This process releases stored carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, upsetting ecosystems and endangering biodiversity. It also exacerbates climate change. The effects affect not only the environment but also nearby towns and the world's weather patterns, underscoring the urgent need for sustainable land management techniques. </p>

        <h2>Causes to these issues</h2>
        <p>The main causes of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest are agricultural practices, particularly cattle ranching and the production of cash crops like soy, which require large-scale land clearing. A major factor is also played by logging, both legal and illicit, since trees are taken down for their wood and paper goods. Road construction and urbanization are examples of infrastructure development that contributes to deforestation by increasing accessibility to and vulnerability to exploitation of isolated areas.</p>

        <h2>The effect that these issues have on the Environment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>loss of plant life:</strong>The loss of plant life can greatly affect the plants population and this can effect the entire food chain/Environment.</li>
            <li><strong>damage of climate</strong>:</strong>Collecting trees can release toxic carbon that they are holding into the Earths athsmosphere, greatly speeding up global warming.</li>
            <li><strong>Animals losing thier homes:</strong>As deforestation worsens in the area overtime animals lose thier food source as the environment worsens eventually causing the animal life to die out or for the animals to be forced to migrate to another Environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Environment completely dying:</strong>Once the Environment has completely died out, there will be no life in the area as a whole due to it being uninhabitable, this is the final result of deforestation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Organizations that work to prevent this Environmental issue</h2>
        <p>There are many Organizations that work to prvent deforestation in the Amazon rain forest, desperatly trying to preserve this forest,Organizations fighting the issue are The Amazon Conservation Team,Amazon Watch,and many others, Amazon watch mainly being based in oakland california A nonprofit group which strives to defend the rights of Indigenous peoples living in the Amazon Basin as well as the rainforest., And the Amazon Conservation Team is mainly based in Arlington virginia where they work with native people and other nearby communities to preserve tropical forests and uphold customs</p>
