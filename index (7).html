        <h2>Environmental issues</h2>
        <p>One main Environmental issue that the amazon rainforest today is Deforestation, which is fueled by logging, infrastructural development, and agriculture, is the main cause of the serious environmental problems the Amazon rainforest faces. In addition to endangering biodiversity, this damage releases enormous amounts of carbon dioxide that are stored in trees, which in turn alters the global climate. In addition, pollution and illicit mining worsen ecosystems, endangering not only the complex web of life that depends on this essential habitat but also the livelihoods of Indigenous groups.</p>

        <h2>Causes to these issues</h2>
        <p>The main causes of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest are agricultural practices, particularly cattle ranching and the production of cash crops like soy, which require large-scale land clearing. A major factor is also played by logging, both legal and illicit, since trees are taken down for their wood and paper goods. Road construction and urbanization are examples of infrastructure development that contributes to deforestation by increasing accessibility to and vulnerability to exploitation of isolated areas.</p>

        <h2>The effect that these issues have on the Environment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>loss of plant life:</strong>The loss of plant life can greatly affect the plants population and this can effect the entire food chain/Environment.</li>
            <li><strong>damage of climate</strong>:</strong>Collecting trees can release toxic carbon that they are holding into the Earths athsmosphere, greatly speeding up global warming.</li>
            <li><strong>Animals losing thier homes:</strong>As deforestation worsens in the area overtime animals lose thier food source as the environment worsens eventually causing the animal life to die out or for the animals to be forced to migrate to another Environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Environment completely dying:</strong>Once the Environment has completely died out, there will be no life in the area as a whole due to it being uninhabitable, this is the final result of deforestation.</li>
        </ul>
